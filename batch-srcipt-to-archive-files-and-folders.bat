REM to archive, specify the folder from which you want to archive [sourceFolder]
REM then specify the filetype (e.g. *.pdf, *.xml,...) [filterFileType] 
REM specify the archive folder you want to archive to [archiveFolder]
REM next specify the depth of archive that will be build - only years, with month or days (year, month,day) [depth]
REM at last give the days that shall be past as a number [numberOfDays]
